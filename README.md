# climate_change_ml
A workbench for various projects dealing with environment, sustainability, or climate change datasets and how to apply machine learning or visualization to them in a useful methodology. As a note, a lot, if not all, of my idea generation was started by this article/website here: https://www.climatechange.ai/summaries. The authors do a great job providing a easy to navigate abundance of ideas about how various data science and machine learning solutions can support a variety of problems facing climate change.

### File Overview
* Concrete_Cracks - A separate folder for fastai implementation of classifying images of concrete of either having cracks or not having cracks
* plot_solar_timeseries.html
  * export file of plot_solar_timeseries.py, can be downloaded and viewed now as a sample without running code
* plot_solar_timeseries.py
  * plots individual solar tracking values and relationships between them and weather data. Also runs some vector regression predictions on the data
* requirements.txt
  * list of the py libraries used in this repo
* webscrape_weather.py
  * code to pull daily weather data over a set frame of time
